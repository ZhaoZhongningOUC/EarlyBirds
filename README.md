# Short-term-prediction
The CNN model, training dataset and test dataset of the paper "Prediction of fishing effort distributions by extracting early bird trawlers based on VMS dataset".
The file "CNN model" includes the training and predicting processes, 
by using the "trainset.h5" and "testset.h5", 
you can directly get the output of "Prediction_Distribution.h5".
The file "Max_Effort" is the maximum effort in the fishing effort distributions of all the trawlers in the training period.
