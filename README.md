# Short-term-prediction
The CNN model, training dataset and test dataset of the paper "Prediction of fishing effort distributions by extracting early bird trawlers based on VMS dataset".
The file "CNN model" includes the training, 
the file "Prediction Process" includes the predicting process,
by using the "trainset.h5" and "testset.h5" (or the "prediction_model.h5" that we provide), 
you can directly get the output of "Prediction.h5".
